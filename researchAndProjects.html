									</header>
									<h3>Research Interests</h3>
									<p>I am extreamly interested in data science and my research is about using machine learning methods to analyze the large -scale time series in real world scenario. </p>
									<h3>Time Series Analyzing in Crowd Sensing</h3>
									<p>Since Dec. 2014, I was honored to join the Advanced Network Laboratory, supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fwu/">Prof. Fan Wu</a>. In most of the time, I was co-supervised by a very talented and nice Ph.D candidate <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kx_5xxEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Zhenzhe Zheng</a>. 
									<br>Our intuition is to find a way to analyze the stochastic and untrustworthy reports generated from the crowd sensing network. We noticed that in a crowd sensing network, the quality of the data will diverge to a large extent according to the different quality of the different devices, and one value at the time point will be synthesized by many reports at different places and different time. Thus, the methods used in traditional sensor networks no longer work in the crowd sensing network, and there is no such a work proposing a way to model the time series for the crowd sensing network. We hope such a model to have the following properties:
									<ul>
										<li>
											Effectiveness: It should be able to capture the correct trend of the time series even if there are noise and human intervention and give a good result.
										</li>
										<li>
											Efficiency: The computation cost of the model should be controled under an acceptable bound. Ideally, it should converge in polynomial time.
										</li>
										<li>
											Trustworthiness: It should be give a reliable interpretation for the trustworthiness of the users. 
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>In our work, we proposed a trust-based Dynamic Bayesian Network to model the time series generated from the crowd sensing network, integrating the hidden variables, the time tick values, and the original reports, capturing the trustworthiness in the crowd sensing of the user. Meanwhile, we also proposed a trust-based EM algorithm to learn the model effectively, solving the problems above. <br>
									This could be my first paper as a first author, and we prepare to submit it to IEEE International Conference on Communications 2017.
									</p>
									<h3>Hot Topic Prediction in Social Networks</h3>
									<p>
										I was honored to join the <b>Big Data Management and Application on Distributed Storage System</b>  research team supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~gao-xf/">Prof. Xiaofeng Gao</a>, led by Renxuan Wang, a talented undergraduate  since Nov. 2015. Our team was qualified as one of the winners of the National Undergraduate Training Programs for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. <br>

										<h2><b>Projects</b></h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										During the three year's study, we are required to finish many projects in different fields. Although they are just course projects, I have tried my best to accomplish them as best as I can, and learned a lot in them.

											<h3>AAAS: Automatic Abdominal Adipose Senmentation</h3>
											<iframe width="640" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hvda03b0oxs">AAAS</iframe><br>
											<p>
												This is the course project of Software Engineering. In this course, I led a group of 3 people, cooperating with a very nice TA, Fei Jiang, designed and developed a automatic segmentation system for the abdominal adipose tissue. The input is a DICOM raw image, and the output is the segmentation result, including the segmentation by DNN shown by black and white, the rate of visceral adipose tissue over the subcutaneous adipose tissue and a volume rendering of a series of contiguous slices implemented by MFC.
